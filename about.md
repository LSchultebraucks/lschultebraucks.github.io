Hi there, my name is Lasse and I am 22 years old.

I have started studying Computer Science in October 2016. In March 2017 I started to work at BROCKHAUS AG as a software developer beside University. Since July 2020 I am working as a full time IT Consultant at BROCKHAUS AG.

My tech stack is full stack and focuses on Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular and Python to name a few.
