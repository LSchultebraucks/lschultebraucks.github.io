Hi there, my name is Lasse and I am 20 years old.

I am studying Computer Science since October 2016. In March 2017 I started to work at Brockhaus AG as a Software Developer beside University.

I am not focusing on specific technologies I want to learn. Of course I prefer some technologies over others, but I basically try
to solve problems and think solution orientated instead of technology orientated. Nevertheless I am a big technology enthusiast and I love playing
with all kind of technology.

The forces me to know a bridge range of technologies which is exactly what I looking for and what makes the most fun to me.
